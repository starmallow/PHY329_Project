The Nagel-Schreckenberg Traffic Model


Kristine Anderson, Srija Lahiri, Nathan Safranek


Description: The problem we are solving is the Nagel-Schreckenberg traffic model. This model simulates freeway traffic as a function of car density, so our solution should accurately depict and simulate traffic at different levels of car density. We may explore traffic modeling more by adding/deleting lanes of traffic, obstacles, etc. to simulate real-time road conditions.



Planned Directory:

- demo.ipynb: an overview of the projecting, starting from introducing the problem, identifying the base model relating traffic and density, highlighting the relationship through various fine-tuned plots, and expanding the plot to further questions and features to be studied

- src/density.py: implements the Nagel-Schreckenberg model with the division of cells

- src/plots.py: creates visuals of the traffic models

- src/extras.py: implements the cellular automaton model while exploring different cell divisions to reproduce traffic jams

Team Member Contributions:
    
    Kristine Anderson:
        * will lead implementation of the different plots and rendering of example videos

    Srija Lahiri:
        * will implement the generic model of the relationship between car density and traffic jams for future plots and unit tests to build on

    Nathan Safranek: 
        * will implement unit tests of how modifying different features (i.e. adding a lane) effects the onset of traffic jams
