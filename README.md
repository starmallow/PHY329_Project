PROJECT TITLE

Kristine Anderson, Srija Lahiri, Nathan Safranek


Description: The problem we are solving is the Nagel-Schreckenberg traffic model. This model simulates freeway traffic as a function of car density, so our solution should accurately depict and simulate traffic at different levels of car density. We may explore traffic modeling more by adding/deleting lanes of traffic, obstacles, etc. to simulate real-time road conditions.

Team Member Contributions:
    
    Kristine Anderson:
        * will lead implementation of the different plots and rendering of example videos

    Srija Lahiri:
        * will implement the generic model of the relationship between car density and traffic jams for future plots and unit tests to build on

    Nathan Safranek: 
        * will implement unit tests of how modifying different features (i.e. adding a lane) effects the onset of traffic jams
