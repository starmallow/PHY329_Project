## Directory:

`demos/demo.ipynb` overviews the project; introduces the problem, explores the base model relation of traffic and density with plots, and demonstrates the expanded lane model 
 - actually put a new description

`code/nsmodel.py` implements the base (circular) Nagel-Schreckenberg cellular automaton model and the additional bottleneck model

(`code/lanes.py` builds upon the Nagel-Schreckenberg model by adding simultaneous lanes) delete?

`demos/analysis.py` implements the streamlined functions for analyzing the models in demo.ipynb

`extras/plots.py` initializes the plot .jpg files to demonstrate the models for the README.md file
